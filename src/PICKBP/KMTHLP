               File Transfer Action Selection~~Enter: S to send items to the remote machine.~       R to receive items from the remote machine.~       C to modify the configuration (permanent settings).~       O to modify the transfer options (temporary settings).~       H to get this help message.~       E to exit file transfer program.~~To get help at any prompt, enter a question mark (?), then~press ENTER.~
                          Filename~~Enter the name of the file from which items are to be sent~or into which items are to be received.~
                         Item List~~Enter a list of items to be sent to the remote machine.~Separate each item-id with a blank.  Item-id's may be~enclosed in single (') or double (") quotation marks, or~enclosed in backslashes ().  If no item list is specified,~then items which have previously been selected via a SELECT~or GET-LIST command will be sent.  If an asterisk (*) is~specified, then all items in the file will be sent.~~To use a previously saved select list, enter the list name~(or list file followed by list name) preceded by an open~parenthesis: e.g. (MY.LIST or (POINTER-FILE CUST.LIST.~
                 Save configuration changes~~Answer "Yes" to write the new configuration to the KMTCFG~item in the program file.  Answer "No" to cancel any changes~made to the configuration.~
                      Modify parameter~~Enter the number of the parameter to modify, or just press~ENTER when no more changes are required.  If the parameter~requires a numeric value, then you will need to enter the~value.  Otherwise, the value of the parameter will toggle~(Yes to No and vice versa).~~Optionally, enter the number of the parameter to modify,~followed by an equal sign, followed by the new value of the~parameter.  For toggles, enter the parameter number, an~equal sign, and the first letter (or letters) of the new~setting (e.g. 13=Y to set parameter number 13 to Yes).~~To get more information about any of the parameters, enter a~question mark followed by the number of the parameter you~are interested in.~
~Enter the number of the option to toggle, or just press ENTER~when no more changes are required.~~Optionally, enter the number of the option to modify,~followed by an equal sign, followed by the first letter (or~letters) of the new setting (e.g.  1=T to set option 1 to~Text).~~To get more information about any of the options, enter a~question mark followed by the number of the option you are~interested in.~
                   File Transfer Protocol~~Select the protocol to be used to transfer data between the~host and the PC. Kermit is always the recommended protocol.~~The ASCII protocol is fast for download, but has no error~detection or handshake. It should only be used when there~is a clean local connection between the machines. The ASCII~protocol may not work correctly unless the data being~transferred is clean text (no control characters). ASCII~uploads are intentionally slow, to prevent data overruns on~the host.~~The KERMIT protocol is much more robust and provides error~detection and correction. It should be used when the~connection between machines involves a modem or the communi-~cation line is noisy. It must be used when non-text (binary)~data is being transferred.~



                    Source buffer index~~This performance tuning parameter is used to determine how~often the source buffer is "pruned".  Many BASIC~implementations incur a significant performance penalty when~accessing a sub-string far from the beginning of a string;~for these systems, a small value (1-500) is indicated.~However, for BASIC implementations which incur no~significant penalty, the maximum value (9999999) is~indicated.  Another tradeoff to consider is that whenever~the buffer is "pruned", a potentially long string must be~stored into a variable, and this also may incur a~performance penalty indicating a moderate value (250-1000).~~This value also affects the outgoing packet size, which is~the lesser of the Maximum Packet Size or the Source Buffer~Index.~
                    Maximum packet size~~This value sets the maximum string length for an incoming~packet.  Its range is 35 to 2000.  The default is 94, which~is the maximum size for a non-extended packet. This value~may be increased to improve throughput, however it must~never exceed the host input buffer size.~
               Retry attempts before failure~~This parameter sets the number of times an incorrect or~corrupted incoming packet is to be resent.  When the remote~system has tried unsuccessfully to send the packet more than~this many times, the file transfer session is aborted.  The~range for this parameter is 1 to 30.~
                     Timeout (seconds)~~This parameter is not used.~
                  Number of pad characters~~If this parameter is non-zero, then any incoming packets are~followed by the specified number of NUL characters (ASCII~00).  Normally, this parameter should be left at zero,~however up to 250 pad characters may be specified.~
                   End-of-line character~~The end-of-line character is the ASCII code used to~terminate incoming packets.  It is normally 13 (carriage-~return) but may be changed to any other control charcter in~the range of 1 to 31.~
                  Control character prefix~~The control character prefix is a printable character which~is used to prefix all control characters (the control~character itself is then transformed to a printable~character).  The normal prefix is ASCII 35 (#) but may be~any character in the range of 33 to 62 or 96 to 126.~
                     Eighth bit prefix~~When eighth bit prefixing is used, this character is used to~prefix all characters which have the high bit set (the~character is then transformed by clearing the high bit).~Eighth bit prefixing is used when the communication channel~or operating system can only process 7 bit characters.  The~normal prefix is ASCII 38 (&) but may be any character in~the range of 33 to 62 or 96 to 126 which is different from~the control character prefix.~
                     Run-length prefix~~This parameter is not used.~
                     Use MCP conversion~~When an implementation supports the MCP (mask character~printable) conversion code, its use greatly enhances the~performance of send operations.  If this code is supported,~leave this parameter set to "Yes", otherwise set it to "No".~
                  Use eighth bit prefixing~~When a communications channel or operating system can only~process 7 bit characters, this parameter should be set to~"Yes".  If 8 bit characters are processed properly it may be~set to "No", however if text files are usually transferred~(high bit usually off), there is little penalty to leaving~eighth bit prefixing on.~
                  Use run-length encoding~~This feature is not implemented.~
                   Default transfer mode~~When the default transfer mode is set to "Text", attribute~marks of transmitted items are converted to carriage-~return/line-feed pairs, converting items to "standard" ASCII~text files.  Received line-feeds are converted to attribute~marks, and received carriage-returns are ignored converting~"standard" ASCII text files to items.  When the default~transfer mode is set to "Binary", no conversion takes place.~This parameter may be overridden during a file transfer~session.~~Note:  many BASIC implementations cannot process ASCII~character 255.~
                  Preserve file extension~~When uploading items from the PC to the host, if the file~name has an "extension" (the part of the file name following~the last period) and this parameter is set to "No", the~file's extension is removed when using the file name as the~host item ID. Otherwise the complete file name is used as~the item ID. This parameter may be overridden during a file~transfer session.~
                  Overwrite existing item~~When an item is recevied which exists in the destination~file, it is overwritten by the received item if this~parameter is set to "Yes", otherwise the received item is~ignored.  This parameter may be overridden during a file~transfer session.~
                  Overwrite existing item~~When an item is recevied which exists in the destination~file, it is overwritten by the received item if this~parameter is set to "Yes", it is ignored if this parameter~is set to "No", and it is merged with (or appended to) the~existing item if this parameter is set to "Merge".  This~parameter may be overridden during a file transfer session.~
                    Large item treatment~~When receiving files greater than 30,000 bytes long, special~handling may be required.  The default is to store the item~without modification. Optionally, the item can be truncated~at approximately 30,000 bytes. Or, the file can be split into~multiple items such that each is less than 30,000 bytes. The~ID of the first item is unchanged;  the ID of the extra items~is formed by concatenating an underscore followed by a~sequential number (starting at _001) to the original ID.~~When sending items, if this parameter is set to "Split",~after the original item has been sent, extra items will be~automatically appended, if they exist, using the above~described procedure for forming the extra item ID's.~
                  Default Field Delimiter~~Select either TAB, Comma or CR/LF as the field separator.~Optionally, a hex string may be specified for the field~separator (use the 3=hh syntax to enter the delimiter in~hex). The delimiter may be more than one character in length.~This parameter may be overridden during a file transfer~session.~~Note: you cannot use CR/LF (or 0D0A or FE in hex) as the~field separator when uploading because CR/LF is always used~as the record separator.~
                  Overwrite existing item~~When an item is recevied which exists in the destination~file, it is overwritten by the received item if this~parameter is set to "Yes", otherwise the received item is~ignored.  This parameter may be overridden during a file~transfer session.~~Note:  if the sender has this parameter set to "Yes" and the~receiver has the parameter set to "No" the transfer is~immediately aborted.~

                       Transfer mode~~When the transfer mode is set to "Text", attribute marks of~transmitted items are converted to carriage-return/line-feed~pairs, converting items to "standard" ASCII text files.~Received line-feeds are converted to attribute marks, and~received carriage-returns are ignored converting "standard"~ASCII text files to items.  When the transfer mode is set~to "Binary", no conversion takes place.~~Note:  many BASIC implementations cannot process ASCII~character 255.~
                  Preserve file extension~~When uploading items from the PC to the host, if the file~name has an "extension" (the part of the file name following~the last period) and this parameter is set to "No", the~file's extension is removed when using the file name as the~host item ID. Otherwise the complete file name is used as~the item ID. This parameter may be overridden during a file~transfer session.~
                  Overwrite existing item~~When an item is recevied which exists in the destination~file, it is overwritten by the received item if this~parameter is set to "Yes", otherwise the received item is~ignored.~~
                  Overwrite existing item~~When an item is recevied which exists in the destination~file, it is overwritten by the received item if this~parameter is set to "Yes", it is ignored if this parameter~is set to "No", and it is merged with (or appended to) the~existing item if this parameter is set to "Merge".  This~parameter may be overridden during a file transfer session.~

                     Field Delimiter~~Select either TAB, Comma or CR/LF as the field separator.~Optionally, a hex string may be specified for the field~separator (use the 3=hh syntax to enter the delimiter in~hex). The delimiter may be more than one character in length.~~Note: you cannot use CR/LF (or 0D0A or FE in hex) as the~field separator when uploading because CR/LF is always used~as the record separator.~
                  Overwrite existing item~~When an item is recevied which exists in the destination~file, it is overwritten by the received item if this~parameter is set to "Yes", otherwise the received item is~ignored.~~Note:  if the sender has this parameter set to "Yes" and the~receiver has the parameter set to "No" the transfer is~immediately aborted.~
             Convert OEM character set to ANSI~~When this option is selected, all files transferred using~FTD, and text files transferred using FT (Binary option not~selected) are converted.  Files transferred from the host~are assumed to contain OEM international character codes,~and are converted to the ANSI character set which is~compatible with Windows.  Files transferred to the host are~assumed to contain ANSI international character codes, and~are converted to the OEM character set.~

Multiple attributes may be specified by~separating each attribute name with a blank.  Attribute~numbers may also be specified (no data conversions are~performed in this case - just raw arrribute data). An~asterisk (*) or plus-sign (+) may also be specified to~indicate "all fields" (note:  no conversion or correlative~processing will be performed when "*" or "+" is used). Use~an asterisk to include the item ID in the transferred data;~use a plus-sign to transfer data attributes only (no item~ID).~

If there is no header record, or if~the field names do not correspond to PICK dictionary~attributes, you must manually specify the attributes to be~transferred.~
                   Attributes To Transfer~~List names of PICK dictionary attributes that define the~data records.  Multiple attributes may be specified by~separating each attribute name with a blank.  Attribute~numbers may also be specified (no data conversions are~performed in this case - just raw arrribute data). A dash~(-) may be used as a dummy attribute name (place holder)~to ignore a particular field in the received record. An~asterisk (*) or plus-sign (+) may also be specified to~indicate "all fields" (note:  no conversion or correlative~processing will be performed when "*" or "+" is used). Use~an asterisk when the first field is used for the item ID;~use a plus-sign when generating sequential item IDs.~
              Number of Header Records to Skip~~Enter the number of initial records to skip.  If the data~file has a header record that does not correspond to the~PICK dictionary attributes in the destination file, you must~skip that header record.~
                     Generate PICK IDs~~Specify whether or not to automatically generate item IDs~for each received record.  Note that unless the item ID has~been specified in the "Attributes to Transfer" (or in the~header record), you MUST generate item IDs.~

You~should also select direct transfer for the sending machine.~~To use an intermediate DOS file as the source, enter "I" for~intermediate.  You will need to specify the name of the DOS~source file, then the target Pick file name.  The specified~DOS file must have been created by using the FTPICK utility.~~Note:  you can only use the Direct transfer feature with~AccuTerm for Windows.~
                    Convert Character Set~~When this option is enabled, data encoded using the host~character set is converted to/from the character set used~by Windows.~~The host character set is selected in the AccuTerm settings,~Font & Character Set page, Host character set encoding. The~Windows character set is selected in the AccuTerm settings,~File Transfer page, Text file encoding.~~Note: for binary transfers, this option is ignored.~







                      Host Server Name~~Enter the server name to be used for this host computer when~AccuTerm is acting as an "automation server".  This name~becomes the ServerName when using the PickServer object.~
