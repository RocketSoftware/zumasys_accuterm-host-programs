phiReport is a suite of reporting tools based on the Pick/MultiValue DBMS. The
application is built using AccuTerm GUI, allowing any Windows user with a
current AccuTerm terminal emulator to define and generate attractive Excel
worksheets from a graphical user interface. Aside from AccuTerm and Microsoft
Excel and Word, no additional software is required on the user workstation.
Once defined, reports can be generated from character-based menus or TCL
commands and exported to the user workstation. Reports can be saved in an
Excel workbook, printed to any Windows printers, saved as a PDF, or e-mailed.

phiReport requires AccuTerm's GUI and Object Bridge support programs.  The
Sample data files are only required if you want to run the demo reports.
