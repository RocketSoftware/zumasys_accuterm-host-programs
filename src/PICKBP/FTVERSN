*
* FTBP Library Maintenance History
*
* 02/17/2002 - 5.0.1
*  Module created
*
* 09/15/2002 - 5.1.1
*  New FTTCL program added. Modified FTSERVER to accept command
*  line argument '1' to enable auto-close. FTSERVER now uses
*  "MultiValue host" as the default server name when no name has
*  been specified in FTSETUP. Minor bug fixes preparing for
*  AccuTerm 2K2 release.
*
* 10/08/2002 - 5.1.2
*  New platform type ULTX added for ancient Ultimate using old
*  EXECUTE syntax and no way to test for stacked input.
*
* 10/29/2002 - 5.1.3
*  Small bug fixed in FTD for UV platform.
*
* 11/29/2002 - 5.1.4
*  New arguments to 'FT' function in converter (FTMODE).
*  New IDLIST syntax in FT, FTD, FTPICK and FTSELECT.
*
* 12/11/2002 - 5.1.5
*  Fixed wizard program name in FTWIZ.
*
* 12/18/2002 - 5.1.6
*  Fixed Q-pointer bug in FTFSI.
*
* 02/14/2003 - 5.1.7
*  Fixed extra 'END ELSE' in FTFSI for JB, UD and UV platforms.
*
* 08/21/2003 - 5.1.8
*  Added new file transfer status message for status code 10 in FTSTATUS.
*
* 09/10/2003 - 5.1.9
*  Added ON ERROR and ELSE clauses to WRITE command in FTSVRSUB.
*
* 09/11/2003 - 5.1.10
*   Modified PRINT expressions for UniVerse because concatenated
*   expressions are sent in separate packets in NT version of
*   UniVerse causing TCP "delayed ack" performance issues. By concatenating
*   a leading NULL, and enclosing the remainder of the PRINT expression
*   within parentheses, forced concanenation of expressions before printing
*   so all elements end up in the same TCP packet. Change affects:
*   DOSSVC, FTCONECT, FTFILIST, FTKERMIT, FTMODE, FTOBJREQ, FTPGMDIR,
*   FTSTATUS, FTSVRSUB.
*
* 09/19/2003 - 5.1.11
*  Modified FTRDITMS to eliminate forcing target file name to upper case.
*
* 09/29/2003 - 5.1.12
*  Modified FTMODE to fix "append comma delimited text file" bug.
*
* 10/09/2003 - 5.1.13
*  Modified FTPICK & FTCONECT to fix problem with echo being turned
*  on in lower level routine. Also fixed unassigned variable problem
*  in FTKERMIT.
*
* 10/21/2003 - 5.1.14

*
* 11/26/2003 - 5.1.16

*  New FTINITEX subroutine added, supercedes FTINIT & FTCLIENV. Performs
*  host capabilities exchange, reads host input buffer size from KMTCFG<52>
*  to enable larger packets when using packetized protocol, for improved
*  performance (GUI, WED, etc.)
*
* 06/12/2006 - 5.3.3
*  Added new FTGETMSG & FTSENDMSG routines for client/server protocol,
*  which are now called by FTOBJREQ and FTSVRSUB. New protocol supports

* 10/27/2006 - 5.3.7
*  Updated FTRDDATA to use ITYPE() function for jBase. Fixed bug in
*  FTFSI for jBase, which caused files to be misidentified as fields.

*  to I-types for Unidata in the sample dictionaries.

*  from FTPICK & FTWTPICK (the correct platform is PICK, not D3).
*
* 04/10/2007 - 5.3.12
*  Added new subroutines: FTSEND, FTRECV, FTEXPORT, FTIMPORT to provide
*  callable version of FT & FTD. Parameters are passed as arguments
*  instead of using DATA statements, and the correct status of the
*  operation is returned. FTRDDATA, FTRDITMS, FTRDBUFF, FTWTITMS and
*  FTKERMIT were updated to return more accurate status information.
*  FTCHK modified to use 'LOCAL COMPLETE' option for UV CATALOG.
*  FTSETUP checks for existing catalog pointers during account setup
